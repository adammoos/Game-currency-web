Hi Mrs, just to inform you about some details you should do :
-change the php headers soo it can work well 
-not all the css or the javascripts are mine soo you may find some proprioreties we didnt learn ( i did learn some of them ) 
-put the work in the www folder of xmapp 
-The folder "connected part" is where the user is connected with his account 
-There are some changes between the connected part and the first homepage ( check nav,currencies page , footer , buying and payment pages )
-when the database ( php) dont work , (the req dont work) it will take you again to the same page ( for exemple when you log in , and you put wrong information , it will tell you to log again without telling you ) 
- i wrote this in english because you learned it and you need some practice  :) 
-payment page have no php/javascript , i canceled it
-send me an email of remarks about the project to me :)
enjoy the project ( dont forget to buy some 😉)
